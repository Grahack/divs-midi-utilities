Current plans for the sequencer project ("Seqer") as of 2021-07-01:

This generation of Seqer is based around a linear piano roll window with note,
numeric value, and label lanes; a sidebar for details; and a cursor for equal
prioritization of mouse and keyboard interaction.  It's built using Qt and
RtMidi.

TODO:
note start/middle/end drag
inspector
keyboard navigation and tweaking
tracks and channels side panels
lane groups
external utils
playback
recording
preferences including ports, colors, and keyboard shortcuts

save lane state
middle drag scroll/zoom
