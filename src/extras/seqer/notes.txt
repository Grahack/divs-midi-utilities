Current plans for the sequencer project ("Seqer") as of 2021-07-01:

This generation of Seqer is based around a linear piano roll window with note,
numeric value, and label lanes; a sidebar for details; and a cursor for equal
prioritization of mouse and keyboard interaction.  It's built using Qt and
RtMidi.
